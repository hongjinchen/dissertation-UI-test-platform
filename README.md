3. Execute the downloaded installer and follow the installation guide.

4. After the installation, open the command prompt or terminal and input the following commands to verify the installation:

   ```
   node -v
   npm -v
   ```

#### 1.2 For Linux (Debian and Ubuntu as examples)

```
sudo apt update

### 2. Install Python and pip

#### 2.1 For Windows

1. Visit the [official Python website](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

2. Download the latest stable version of Python suitable for your OS.

3. Run the downloaded installer. Ensure you select the option "Add Python to PATH" or a similar option during the installation process.

4. After the installation, open the command prompt and verify with:

   ```
   python --version
   pip --version
   ```

#### 2.2 For macOS

macOS typically comes preinstalled with Python, but it might be Python 2. To install Python 3 and pip, it's recommended to use Homebrew:

```
brew install python3
```

Verify the installation:

```
python3 --version
pip3 --version
```

#### 2.3 For Linux (Debian and Ubuntu as examples)

```
sudo apt update
sudo apt install python3 python3-pip
```

Verify the installation:

```
python3 --version
pip3 --version
```

### 3. Run React Project

Navigate to the project directory and start it:

```
cd ui-test
npm run start
```

Make sure the API_BASE_URL in the config.js file is "http://localhost:5000"

### 4. Run Flask Project

#### 4.1 Install dependencies

Before running the Flask project, make sure to install all required packages listed in `requirements.txt`.

Navigate to the backend directory:

```
cd backend
```

Install the dependencies:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

#### 4.2 Run the Flask application

Now, run the Python script:

```
python run.py
```

## 5. Configure MySQL Database

### 5.1 **Install MySQL**:

#### For Ubuntu:

```
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install mysql-server
```

#### For CentOS:

```
sudo yum install mysql-server
sudo systemctl start mysqld
```

#### For Windows:

Please visit the [MySQL Official Download Page](https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/installer/) and download the appropriate installer for your system version, then follow the prompts to install.

### 5.2 **Configure MySQL Security**:

#### For Linux Systems:

Run MySQL's security script for initial security configuration.

```
sudo mysql_secure_installation
```

If you haven't set a MySQL password before, set it as `chen526` during this step. If you prefer a different password, remember the one you set and replace `chen526` with your MySQL password in the `config.py` file.

#### For Windows:

During the installation process, you will usually be guided through the security setup.

### 5.3 **Log in to MySQL and Set Up the Database**:

#### For Linux Systems:

Use the following command to log into MySQL:

```
mysql -u root -p
```

After entering your password, you'll be in MySQL's command-line mode.

#### For Windows:

Log in using MySQL Workbench or another MySQL client tool of your choice.

Then, create a new database named `UI_test`:

```
CREATE DATABASE UI_test;
```

To exit the MySQL command line:

```
exit;
```

### 5.4 **Import SQL Data**:

Import your `init.sql` file into the `UI_test` database you just created.

#### For Linux Systems:

```
mysql -u root -p UI_test < init.sql
```

#### For Windows:

You can use phpMyAdmin to accomplish this task.

**Note:**

This SQLAlchemy connection is as follows:

```
SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URI = 'mysql+pymysql://root:chen526@localhost/UI_test'
```

If necessary, make modifications in the `config.py` file of the Python project.



## Running the project with docker

### **Deploying a Python Flask Application Using Docker and Docker Compose**

In this guide, we will walk you through deploying a Python Flask application using Docker and Docker Compose.

#### **1. Install Docker:**

- If you haven't installed Docker yet, visit the [Docker Official Website](https://www.docker.com/) and follow the installation guide suitable for your operating system.

#### **2. Install Docker Compose:**

- Docker Compose lets you define and run multi-container applications using a `docker-compose.yml` file. Head over to the [Official Installation Guide for Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/) and follow the steps.

#### **3. Build and Launch Containers:**

- Open your terminal or command prompt and navigate to the project directory that has the `Dockerfile` and `docker-compose.yml`.
- Execute the command `docker-compose build` to build your web service.
- Follow it up with `docker-compose up` to start your web and db services.

#### **4. Access the Application:**

- Launch your web browser and navigate to [http://localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000/). You should now see your Python Flask application up and running.

#### **5. Shutdown Services:**

- When you're done and wish to shut down the services, use the command `docker-compose down` to stop all associated services.

### Building a Docker Image of front end project

From the root directory of the project, execute the following command to build a Docker image:

```
docker build -t UI_test .
```

This will construct a Docker image named `UI_test` based on your `Dockerfile`.

#### Running the Docker Container

To run your application, use the command below:

```
docker run -p 3000:3000 UI_test
```

This initiates a new Docker container instance based on the `UI_test` image. The `-p 3000:3000` flag maps the container's port 3000 to port 3000 on the host machine.

#### Accessing the Application

Visit [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000/) in your browser, and you should see your application running.
